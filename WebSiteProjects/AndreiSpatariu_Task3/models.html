            <p>
                Raptor is our most popular model,
                <br>a very versatile instrument of classic design.
                <br>With wide array of options available it may become
                <br>what any player seeks for himself.

            <p>
                It uses the Raptor model and sharing its versatility.
                <br>More aggressive appearance isn't the only difference.
                <br>Nebelung borrows some ergonomic features from Swan and
                <br>Shoggie models and both it's top and back are radius curved.
                <br>Only selected wood species are used as body and neck
                <br>material to ensure balanced sound.

            <p>
                Prioritizing comfort and tone it's one of our most ergonomic designs
                <br>designed with multi-scaled instruments in mind. Swan has radius curved
                <br>top with ergonomic contours. We don't offer chambering for this model.

        <a><img src = "http://skervesen.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tamandua1.png"/>Tamandua
            <p>
                This is how we imagine a contemporary Tele. Tamandua features a resonant
                <br>chamber under an inlaid pickguard. Wood choices for this model were made 
                <br>with particular tone goal we had in mind.

            <p>
                  This is our nod toward a classic designs combined with modern technology
                  <br>and appropriate wood selection. To have better control over tone we limited 
                  <br>choice of wood species available â€“ especially as material for neck. 
                  <br>Multi-scale isn't available for Kallisti. 
                  <br>At the moment we offer only 22 fret neck for this model.
